Chemistry/Mol version 0.22
==========================

This toolkit includes basic objects and methods to describe molecules. It
consists of several modules: Chemistry::Mol, Chemistry::Atom, Chemistry::Bond,
and Chemistry::File. These are the core modules of the PerlMol toolkit;
see http://www.perlmol.org/.

The core methods try not to commit to a particular convention, therefore fields
such as the bond type have no intrinsic meaning. Bonds are defined as a list of
atoms (typically two) with an arbitrary type. Atoms are defined by a symbol and
a Z, and may have 3D coordinates (2D and internal coming soon).

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.21
        - Fixed bug where $/ was undef'ed in a nonlocal way in File.pm.

        - Added %j and %% formats to Formula.pm.
