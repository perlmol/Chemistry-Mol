Chemistry/Mol version 0.20
==========================

This toolkit includes basic objects and methods to describe molecules. It
consists of several modules: Chemistry::Mol, Chemistry::Atom, Chemistry::Bond,
and Chemistry::File. These are the core modules of the PerlMol toolkit;
see http://www.perlmol.org/.

The core methods try not to commit to a particular convention, therefore fields
such as the bond type have no intrinsic meaning. Bonds are defined as a list of
atoms (typically two) with an arbitrary type. Atoms are defined by a symbol and
a Z, and may have 3D coordinates (2D and internal coming soon).

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.11
        - Use Scalar::Util::weaken to avoid strong cyclic references
          and ensure garbage collection.
        - New methods for Chemistry::Mol: delete_atom, delete_bond,
          clone, combine, separate, distance
        - New methods for Chemistry::Atom: angle, dihedral, angle_deg, 
          dihedral_deg, delete
        - New methods for Chemistry::Bond: delete
        - Chemistry::Mol can export read_mol
        - Chemistry::Atom can export distance, angle, dihedral

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES
