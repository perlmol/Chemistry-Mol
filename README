Chemistry/Mol version 0.37
==========================

This toolkit includes basic objects and methods to describe molecules. It
consists of several modules: Chemistry::Mol, Chemistry::Atom, Chemistry::Bond,
and Chemistry::File. These are the core modules of the PerlMol toolkit;
see http://www.perlmol.org/.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.36
        - Parse non-integer formulas (Daniel Scott).
        - Fixed some typos.
        - Fixed bug in Chemistry::File, where $self->mols wasn't updated
          during the read loop.
        - Fixed bug where $atom->symbol tried to modify the symbol given
          (which crashed when the symbol was a constant!)
        - Added an undocumented "next_id" method (Liliana Felix Avila).
        - Documented the descriptor methods that existed since 0.36 but were
          undocumented.
