Chemistry/Mol version 0.10
==========================

This toolkit includes basic objects and methods to describe molecules. It
consists of several modules, including Chemistry::Mol, Chemistry::Atom, 
and Chemistry::Bond.

The core methods try not to commit to a particular convention, therefore fields
such as the bond type have no intrinsic meaning. Bonds are defined as a list of
atoms (typically two) with an arbitrary type. Atoms are defined by a symbol and
a Z, and may have 3D coordinates (2D and internal coming soon).
