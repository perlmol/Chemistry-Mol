Revision history for Perl extension Chemistry::Mol.

0.10  Oct 31?
        - New methods for Chemistry::Mol: atoms, bonds, by_id, atoms_by_name
        - New methods for Chemistry::Atom: distance
        - New methods for Chemistry::Obj: del_attr
        - New subroutines for Chemistry::Mol: read_mol, register_format
        - New class method for Mol, Atom, and Bond: reset_id
        - Incompatible changes:
            - Changed File I/O API. It should be more stable now, but it's
              certainly not frozen yet.
            - Chemistry::Mol->atoms() and bonds() now use 1-based indexing
              instead of zero-based.
            - Now Chemistry::Obj overloads cmp instead of ==. Note that this
              overloading behavior was undocumented, so it shouldn't cause a
              problem.
