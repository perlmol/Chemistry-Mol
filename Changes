Revision history for Perl extension Chemistry::Mol.

0.22  Mon May 17 2004
        - Fixed bug in bonds($from)
        - Added add_atom_np, add_bond_np, bonds_neighbors
        - Fixed another memory leak
        - Added Atom::formal_charge

0.21  Thu May 13 2004
        - Fixed bug where $/ was undef'ed in a nonlocal way in File.pm.
        - Added formula parser contributed by Brent Gregersen.
        - Added %j and %% formats to Formula.pm.

0.20  Thu May 06 2004
        - Use Scalar::Util::weaken to avoid strong cyclic references
          and ensure garbage collection.
        - New methods for Chemistry::Mol: delete_atom, delete_bond,
          clone, combine, separate, distance
        - New methods for Chemistry::Atom: angle, dihedral, angle_deg, 
          dihedral_deg, delete
        - New methods for Chemistry::Bond: delete
        - Chemistry::Mol can export read_mol
        - Chemistry::Atom can export distance, angle, dihedral

0.11  Sun Feb 22 2004
        - New methods for Chemistry::Mol: mass, formula, formula_hash
        - New methods for Chemistry::Atom: mass
        - New module: Chemistry::File::Formula

0.10  Mon Nov 03 2003
        - New methods for Chemistry::Atom: distance
        - New methods for Chemistry::Obj: del_attr
        - New subroutines for Chemistry::Mol: read_mol, register_format
        - New class method for Mol, Atom, and Bond: reset_id
        - Incompatible changes:
            - Changed File I/O API. It should be more stable now, but it's
              certainly not frozen yet.
            - Chemistry::Mol->atoms() and bonds() now use 1-based indexing
              instead of zero-based.
            - Now Chemistry::Obj overloads cmp instead of ==. Note that this
              overloading behavior was undocumented, so it shouldn't cause a
              problem.
